## Hi 👋 My name is Dominik

<strong>Final-year Computer Science Student and Full Stack Developer</strong>

I'm currently a student of Computer Science and a self-taught programmer. I have been programming for over 3 years. I started with Java, which remains my strongest skill, but I've also developed strong frontend abilities with React.js. I'm now focusing on expanding my knowledge in the DevOps field and actively looking for my first job.
