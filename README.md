## Hi 👋 My name is Dominik

<strong>Computer Science Engineer and Full Stack Developer</strong>

I'm a Computer Science graduate (Engineer) from the Silesian University of Technology and a passionate self-taught programmer. I've been programming for 4 years, working on personal projects and continuously expanding my skills. I started with Java, which remains one of my strongest languages, and over time I developed frontend skills using React.js.

Recently, I completed a 6-month internship as a Python Developer working with AWS, Elasticsearch and large language models.

I'm actively looking for a full-time position as a Python or Java Developer. I'm also open to roles involving frontend technologies.
